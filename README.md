# DBSys-lab-2

## Context

This is the git repository associed with the work of Victor MASIAK and Hugo DANET regarding the part 2 of DBSys Lab Assignments (EURECOM 2020).

## Structure

This repository contains 4 directories :
* Reference : contains the assignment and the original paper.
* Code : contains the .java files created/modified for the assignment purpose.
* Output : contains the output of the BMTest2020.java execution, and some notes from Victor MASIAK and Hugo DANET.
* Complete project : contains all the files required to run the project.

## How to run the project

In order to run the test file, the following command will NOT work:

'javac javaminibase/src/tests/BMTest2020.java'

Indeed, due to errors in some files unrelated to the assignment, the code will not compile.We advise you to open it in Eclipse, and to run the tests/BMTest2020.java file: Eclipse will allow you to ignore the errors since the concerned files are not executed.
