Running Buffer Management tests....
Replacer: Clock


  Test 1 does simple test on buffer using theFIFOalgorithmmanager operations:
Replacer: FIFO

  - Allocate a bunch of new pages
  - Write something on each one
  - Read that something back from each one
   (because we're buffering, this is where most of the writes happen)
  - Free the pages again
  Test 1 completed successfully.

  Test 1 does simple test on buffer using theLIFOalgorithmmanager operations:
Replacer: LIFO

  - Allocate a bunch of new pages
  - Write something on each one
  - Read that something back from each one
   (because we're buffering, this is where most of the writes happen)
  - Free the pages again

  Test 2 exercises some illegal buffer manager operations:FIFO
Replacer: FIFO

  - Try to pin more pages than there are frames
  --> Failed as expected 

*** Pinning too many pages
  - Try to free a doubly-pinned page
  --> Failed as expected 

*** Freeing a pinned page
  - Try to unpin a page not in the buffer pool
  --> Failed as expected 

*** Unpinning a page not in the buffer pool
  Test 2 completed successfully.
